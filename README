WARNING: UNSTABLE CODE

GX is a GS-Style interface to wxErlang, the Erlang port of wxWidgets. 
GX also introduces an HTML/XUL-style format for GUI definition. 

The POC results were very promising, and so development of the beta 
library is now underway.

You need:
- EITHER: Erlang/OTP R13A which includes wxErlang 0.98. 
- OR: Erlang/OTP 12B-5 with wxErlang 0.97 installed on your ERL_LIBS 
  library path.
- You MUST run the BEAM VM with smp enabled (and also use werl on Windows)
i.e. (w)erl -smp enable

- Many basic components are available and the core event model is in place. 
  However, there are still many large gaps while development of the full 
  framework continues.
- Owing to a major refactor, all documentation is either OUT OF DATE or 
  incomplete! You'll have to RTSL for the moment 
- Will be updating the docs shortly with a full tutorial/reference.
- Note that the modules use resources from priv/gx

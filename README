WARNING: UNSTABLE CODE

Prototyping to see how a GS-Style interface could work with the wxErlang 
port of wxWidgets. The POC/first results have been very promising.

- You need wxErlang already installed in your library path.
- You must run the VM with smp enabled (and also use werl on Windows)
- There is very limited support for anything at all so far.

Owing to a major refactor, all documentation is OUT OF DATE! 

You'll have to RTSL for the moment... will be updating the docs during 
3/14 and 3/15 (2009).

The modules use resources from priv/gx

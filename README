EXPERIMENTAL CODE ONLY

Prototyping to see how a GS-Style interface could work with the wxErlang 
port of wxWidgets.

- You need wxErlang already installed in your library path.
- There is very limited support for anything at all so far.

- Compile the src and then try out using
gx_client:start() % example of using a term to crate the UI
gxml_client:start() % example of using XML to create the UI

The modules use resources from priv/gx

EXPERIMENTAL CODE ONLY

Prototyping to see how a GS-Style interface could work with the wxErlang 
port of wxWidgets.

- You need wxErlang already installed in your library path.
- You must run the VM with smp enabled (and also use werl on Windows)
- There is very limited support for anything at all so far.

- Compile the src and then try out using

gx_client:start() % example of using a term to crate the UI
gxml_client:start() % example of using XML to create the UI

The gx_client uses either a term file or an inline UI definition
The gxml_client uses an external xml definition (see: priv/gx/test.xml)

The modules use resources from priv/gx
